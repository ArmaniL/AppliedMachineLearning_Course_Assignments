# AppliedMachineLearning_Course_Assignments
This repo contains all of the work that I have done in my applied machine learning course. The course covers topics from unsupervised and supervised machine learning. 
These include SVM,K-Means and Decision Tree to name a few. The course also ended with a project where an algorithm was applied to a given dataset. Within my project I explored 
the use of clustering with the eucalyptus dataset.
